# PBWTLib

Just classilized. It's not really elegant, and I don't see there are any significances to do so, I just did it. And to make it really meaningful, there will be a huge amount work to do. So, It's currently shelved.

The master branch is now the main branch, it just C++lized the Richard Durbin's work. Nothing more, so you can use c++ feature like STLs with it.
